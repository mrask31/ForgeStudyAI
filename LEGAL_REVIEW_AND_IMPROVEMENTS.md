# Legal Review: Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

## Executive Summary
Your current Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are **good foundations** but need several critical enhancements to be lawsuit-proof, especially for:
- Healthcare/educational contexts (FERPA considerations)
- AI/data processing (third-party disclosures)
- International compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- Subscription/refund policies
- Explicit user acceptance mechanisms

## Critical Issues Found

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Must Fix Before Launch

#### 1. **Missing Explicit Acceptance During Signup**
- **Current State:** Links only in footer
- **Risk:** Terms may not be enforceable if users can claim they didn't see them
- **Fix Required:** Add checkbox during signup requiring explicit acceptance

#### 2. **Missing Third-Party AI Provider Disclosure (Privacy Policy)**
- **Current State:** Generic "industry-leading AI providers"
- **Risk:** Transparency requirements, potential GDPR violations
- **Fix Required:** Explicitly name OpenAI, describe data sharing relationship

#### 3. **Missing Refund/Cancellation Policy (Terms)**
- **Current State:** No explicit refund terms
- **Risk:** Consumer protection violations, chargeback issues
- **Fix Required:** Clear refund policy (e.g., "7-day trial, no refunds after trial period")

#### 4. **Governing Law Too Vague (Terms)**
- **Current State:** "United States" (too broad)
- **Risk:** Jurisdictional confusion
- **Fix Required:** Specify state (e.g., "State of Delaware" - common for LLCs)

#### 5. **Missing Data Breach Notification (Privacy Policy)**
- **Current State:** No timeline for breach notifications
- **Risk:** State law violations (most states require notification within 72 hours)
- **Fix Required:** Add explicit breach notification policy

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Strongly Recommended

#### 6. **Missing GDPR-Specific Rights (Privacy Policy)**
- **Issue:** No explicit mention of GDPR rights if serving EU users
- **Recommendation:** Add section covering:
  - Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
  - Right to data portability
  - Legal basis for processing (legitimate interest/consent)
  - Data Protection Officer contact info (if applicable)

#### 7. **Missing CCPA Rights (Privacy Policy)**
- **Issue:** California residents have additional rights
- **Recommendation:** Add section covering:
  - Right to know what personal information is collected
  - Right to delete personal information
  - Right to opt-out of sale (you already say you don't sell, but should state explicitly)
  - Non-discrimination clause

#### 8. **Missing Arbitration/Class Action Waiver (Terms)**
- **Current State:** No dispute resolution mechanism
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding binding arbitration clause (reduces litigation costs)
  - **Note:** Some states (CA, NY) have restrictions on mandatory arbitration
  - **Alternative:** Keep court jurisdiction but add specific venue

#### 9. **Missing Cookie/Tracking Disclosure (Privacy Policy)**
- **Issue:** No mention of cookies, analytics, or tracking technologies
- **Recommendation:** Add section describing:
  - Types of cookies used (essential, analytics, etc.)
  - How users can manage cookie preferences
  - Third-party analytics (if using Google Analytics, etc.)

#### 10. **FERPA Considerations (Privacy Policy)**
- **Issue:** Educational records protection not explicitly addressed
- **Recommendation:** Add statement that:
  - ForgeNursing is not an educational institution
  - Records are not "educational records" under FERPA
  - Clarify relationship with schools (if applicable)

#### 11. **Missing DMCA Procedure (Terms)**
- **Issue:** No copyright infringement takedown procedure
- **Recommendation:** Add DMCA takedown procedure with designated agent

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY - Nice to Have

#### 12. **Force Majeure Clause (Terms)**
- Protects against service disruptions due to unforeseen circumstances

#### 13. **More Specific Date (Both)**
- Change "December 2024" to specific date (e.g., "December 15, 2024")

#### 14. **International Data Transfer Disclosure (Privacy Policy)**
- Explicitly state where data is stored (US) and that international users consent to transfer
